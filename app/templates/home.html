				<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
				<p>
					During our first week of the MLH Fellowship program on the Production
					Engineering group, we were tasked with creating a portfolio site! We
					made this portfolio site with the template given to us and our tasks.
				</p>
				<h3>Our Learning Experience</h3>
				<p>
					This project has been a wonderful opportunity to explore flask and web
					development. In addition, none of us has ever worked with Jinja so
					this has been a new experience for all of us. Outside of our given
					resources, we were able to fiddle with CSS and Javascript to spice up
					our profiles/create working world maps. Most notably, we've been doing
					a really good job familiarizing ourselves with Git lately and the Git
					version control system. We've been pushing features into our own
					branches and creating pull requests for merging into main. Overall,
					it's been a fulfilling experience.
				</p>
				<h3>Our Challenges</h3>
				<p>
					One of our biggest challenges had been using Jinja because it was
					something we weren't familiar with at all. For most of our problems we
					had to look things up on Stack Overflow or work together to resolve
					problems together that came up. Despite this challenge we were able to
					pull through and resolve our conflicts. We learned a lot of new things
					about Jinja through the project
